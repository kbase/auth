NOTE FOR MACOS LION AND HIGHER

Download the module from CPAN, then edit Makefile.PL. Change:

cc_optimize_flags('-O2 -g -Wall -Werror');
to
cc_optimize_flags('-O2 -g');

Then, in the generated Makefile, remove clang flags for -arch ppc -arch ppc64.

You can then proceed with make, make install as normal. It will throw a lot of errors now
but it's the best we can do.

Mountain Lion users may need to upgrade OpenSSL as well, and edit the Makefile.PL to point
to the appropriate newly installed library.
